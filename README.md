# Arvensis Systems Ethereum Template

This template comes with a Next.js web app and a Foundry development container. The template is deliberately minimal to allow for maximum customization without having to wrangle with it, while providing just enough to get started.

The template uses the `bun` package manager for both the web app and the Foundry app.

Built using Next.js, RainbowKit, Foundry, wagmi, viem and TypeScript.

## Commands

```bash
bun dev # Starts the local blockchain, deploys contracts and starts the frontend

bun test # Runs Foundry tests
bun run deploy # Deploys contracts
bun chain # Starts the local blockchain

bun start # Starts the frontend
bun run build # Builds the frontend
bun serve # Serves a built frontend in production mode
```
